1. If you want to use the compiled code/assets just check the `compiled files` folder. You can see the `index.html` file and the `assets` folder.

2. If you want to edit the raw files just run and compile the `raw files` using Gulp. 
Put the contents of the `raw files` folder in your `C`, then go to your folder using the `cd` command using your selected `CMD`. Then, `install npm` and run `gulp`. After running gulp the page will open to your default browser.

Example
- cd <folder_name>
- npm install
- gulp


If running the program using Gulp will not work on your end, just use the `compiled files` and override the styles/scripts if you have some changes.
 

Thank you so much!
